## My journey
Once upon a time, a young boy named Wade, started using computers when he was 7, this boy liked to discover the Windows OS in its entirety, tried new things, like hosting game servers, to create his own place where he could bring people together. He was amazed by video games, playing them was something so fun to him, but he wanted something bigger, make his own video games and softwares. That's how he started his developer journey, discovering the Unreal Engine development environment, various programming languages like Lua, C++, Javascript, Typescript and using tools like Blender to make 3D models, and promoting his projects using graphic design.

This is the beginning of an ambitious journey, that's how he created DinographicPixels, an independent unregistered company that makes software, games, developer tools and more.

At a very young age, I've started the development of a video game, for 3 years, but unfortunately, by working too hard on it, I did a burnout, which postponed a lot of my projects and ideas, as I needed years to recover.

I'm now developing new projects to reach ambitious goals, focusing on details.

## More details
I'm a software engineer, game developer & web developer.
I also do graphic designs, 3D models, and more.
