# Polymathic Journey in Technology and Creativity

I am an autodidact with a passion for creation, delving into diverse fields such as modding, game development, web development, 3D modeling, graphic design, and interactive design. My journey began at the age of 7, starting with an unused PC at home. My curiosity led me from exploring Windows OS to hosting game servers, driven by a desire to build and lead a community.

Excited by the release of Windows 10, I bypassed compatibility issues and installed it myself, a testament to my early problem-solving skills. My foray into web development began with HTML and CSS, evolving through hands-on experimentation and practice.

My ambition to create my own video games took me to Unreal Engine, where I honed my logic skills, 3D modeling, animation, and even sound design. Over three years, I developed a horror game named WaitingForHero. However, intense dedication led to burnout, pausing this project.

Programming became a core focus, starting with Lua and expanding to JavaScript and Node.JS. I created numerous Discord applications, one of which gained significant traction with over 800 servers and verification by Discord. This experience deepened my understanding of coding concepts and APIs.

Transitioning to TypeScript with ESLint, I improved code maintainability and style. Being accepted to the private Guilded Developer server made me realize the opportunity of creating a library, so I took it, and it inspired me to create TouchGuild, a library for Guildedâ€™s platform. My current endeavors include porting a communication library in C++, private projects and managing DinographicPixels an independent entity producing software, games, and developer tools.

My story is one of relentless learning, cross-disciplinary innovation, and ambitious goals. Each project adds to my multifaceted skill set, enabling me to bring complex, creative visions to life.

And this is, only the beginning.
