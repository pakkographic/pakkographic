## My journey
I would introduce myself as someone that is autodidact and passionate about creation, from modding, game development, web development, 3D modeling, graphic designs to refined designs and interactions. Let's say that I tried a lot of things out there.

My journey began when I was around 7, as a young boy, having a PC that was unused at home, began to discover, step by step, from manipulating the Windows OS to playing video games, by playing a game for quite some time, I realized over the months that I wanted to have a community, my own community, and create a video game server for that game. That's was my first step doing some researches on how to host a game server.

When Windows 10 released, I was very excited, that sleek new design really amazed me, I had a PC running on Windows Vista, which was judged incompatible so I couldn't upgrade, at my young age I made a bootable USB to install Windows 10 anyways.

Then I manipulated websites, tried to understand how it worked, learned how HTML and CSS works by editing and practicing by myself so I could create my own websites.

After all of that, I wanted to create a video game using Unreal Engine, so I began learning how this works, that's how I developed my logic skills, as well as 3D modeler/animator ones (and a lot more stuff that is developed when creating a video game, including making some MIDI sounds for it/sound effects).

After 3 years of development a game that was named WaitingForHero, a horror and stress game, unfortunately I did a burnout by developing everyday and working way too hard on it.

I learned Lua as my first language, trying to understand how it works by editing simple code, and practicing, then I learned JavaScript for web development and get a more in depth knowledge about it, especially Node.JS by making a LOT (maybe too much) Discord Applications and automating actions using their API, which made me understand a lot of concepts, syntaxes and possibilities with time.

One day, I decided to actually make something fun, and wanted to make it widely available, it wasn't a very serious project, but the application was inspired by Dank Memer. It was added on 800+ servers, and has been verified by Discord, I decided to update it daily, due to the lack of ressources, I had to shut it down, and decided to develop a new version that is intended to be widely available and accessible to everyone, a version that would easily surpass the old one.

Then, I switched to TypeScript with a linter (ESLint) with strict rules, reinforcing code maintainability, and my own code syntax and coding style. Years after that, I discovered Guilded a platform very similar to Discord. Being accepted in the Guilded Developer server (which was private at the time), I had the opportunity to make a library for it, so I took it. That's how the TouchGuild library was born.

I've been porting/recreating a library that is a layer of communication between the developer's project & the API with C++ and this is still currently in development, it was open source as I had paused the development of it to focus on a more important project, and.. and here we are now, of course I probably forgot a lot of things in the story, lot of things that I've learned, but it's a long story short.

This is the beginning of an ambitious journey, that's how he created DinographicPixels, an independent unregistered company that makes software, games, developer tools and more.

# Story short
Once upon a time, a young boy named Wade, started using computers when he was 7, this boy liked to discover the Windows OS in its entirety, tried new things, like hosting game servers, to create his own place where he could bring people together. He was amazed by video games, playing them was something so fun to him, but he wanted something bigger, make his own video games and software. That's how he started his developer journey, discovering the Unreal Engine development environment, various programming languages like Lua, C++, Javascript, Typescript and using tools like Blender to make 3D models, and promoting his projects using graphic design.

This is the beginning of an ambitious journey, that's how he created DinographicPixels, an independent unregistered company that makes software, games, developer tools and more.

At a very young age, I've started the development of a video game, for 3 years, but unfortunately, by working too hard on it, I did a burnout, which postponed a lot of my projects and ideas, as I needed years to recover.

Now, I'm developing new projects to reach ambitious goals, focusing on details.

## Even more details (like there isn't enough..)
Self-taught Software Engineer & Web Developer, while also doing graphic design, 3D models and more.
I also do business, to bring my projects to life.
